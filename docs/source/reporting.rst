Reporting Overview
=====================

Reports listed in this catalog are built, tested, and verified by the analytics foundations pod. There may be other pod reporting or CPH customer reporting that can be found in our analytics systems.
However, these reports will not show up in this catalogue given that they've been built by team members outside of the trusted analytics environment. 

We've organized our reporting by three large buckets based on how reporting can be utilized throughout the organization:

:ref:`operations`
--------------------

* **Reporting for Leadership:** This includes but is not limited to OKR reports. These reports live on Mode

* **Reporting for Pods:** This includes but is not limited to reporting to support pod QPRs, reporting to support common reporting shared across pods, etc. These reports live on Mode. 

:ref:`commercial`
--------------------

* **Reporting to Support CPH Customers:** This includes but is not limited to reporting found in CPH collections such as Registration, Visit Summary, and Heartbeat metrics. These reports live across Mode & Tableau.

* **Reporting to Support Clover MA:** This includes but is not limited to reporting to support our Clover MA teams such as the CCS team, the actuarial team, etc 


:ref:`external`
--------------------

* **Reporting in the CA Application:** This includes but is not limited to reporting found in the application such as our panel report, visit report, and care gaps report. These reports live in Tableau 

* **Reporting Exports for CPH Customers:** These are raw data exports built for data savvy CPH customers that have a need to deeply analyze their data to generate metrics outside of the ones we have created for them.
