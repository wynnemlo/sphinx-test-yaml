CPH Analytics Catalog
============================
**Your one stop shop for documentation on all things reporting, metrics, and data models
built by the Analytics Foundations Pod.**

The Analytics Catalog aims to streamline the sharing of data knowledge 
across all end users for analytics by creating a single place for users 
to find information on analytics products created by the Analytics Foundations pod. 

This platform will surface definitions on metrics we have built, documentation on 
where to find and when to use trusted reports that house those metrics, 
and meta-data & documentation on the models that power those metrics. 
This catalog is a living platform, and as we continue to build, audit, and release trusted data,
we will continue to surface the end to end information here.


Check out the :doc:`reporting` section for information on how to find critical Mode & Tableau reports.

Check out the :doc:`metrics` section for in depth definitions on metrics, and which reports to navigate to in order to find those metrics.

Check out the Tables section for an overview of all the core & contextual models in our analytics layers
